<p>Hi, my name is <mark>Quinn Hanson.</mark> I was born and raised in <em>Ottawa, Ontario</em> on May 8<sup>th</sup> 1999. I attended <abbr title="Canterbury Highschool">CHS</abbr> from 2014 to 2017. After that I went to <abbr title="lakehead university">LHU</abbr> for the Criminology program. After three years in the program, covid and completely online classes I decided to take some time off to work. During this time I had a bunch of random jobs such as a cable guy, fry cook and maintenance officer. All of these choices led me to Algonquin as I realized I liked computers far more than working with my hands. </p>
<p>Outside of school I'm really into gaming, in particular Dungeons and Dragons<sub>5E</sub> I love all the crazy hyjinx the players can get up too. One of my favourite moments was when the party accidently released a giant skeleton into a townsquare causing the townsfolk to freakout resulting in one of the best lines I've heard. <blockquote>"Guys I think we just accidently caused mass panic again" <cite>My Gaming Group</cite> </blockquote> </p>
